<h1>Last War Community Website</h1>

<p>This is a website created by a community member, for the community. It is based on information from <a href="https://www.lastwartutorial.com/">this website</a>, but I have been unable to contact its developer.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>My goal is not to plagiarize, but to continue the work of what I perceive to be a defunct website. The resources on the original site are very good, but the structure and readability are not. This project aims to be a non-profit, open-source, community-maintained website.</p>

<h2>Why a new website?</h2>
<p>I am building a foundation for future expansion. Because the original site is built on WordPress, we can't add or edit any information directly. Therefore, I chose NextJS for this project, as its combined front and back-end structure makes it a perfect fit for a community-maintained website.</p>

<h2>Get Involved!</h2>

<p>I've laid the foundation with the original content from <a href="https://www.lastwartutorial.com/">this website</a>. </p>

<h3>For Developers:</h3>
<p> If you're a developer who wants to help maintain this project, take a look at the components and page structure. Contact me on GitHub, and we can chat on Discord (or your preferred platform) about getting you access to the repository.</p>

<h3>For Everyone:</h3>
<p>I want non-developers to have a say in this website too! I've built the foundation for an API and integrated basic commenting functionality on the main page. The plan is to expand this, allowing users to submit draft articles. If the community likes an article, it will be included on the website.</p>

<h2>Planned Improvements</h2>

<p>As a back-end developer, I'm always learning best practices for front-end development.  To improve this website, I plan to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Centralize image management:</strong> Currently, image locations are defined within individual components. I plan to migrate to a more centralized approach, potentially using a database for improved organization and scalability.</li>
  <li><strong>Implement TypeScript interfaces for images:</strong> This will provide better type safety and maintainability as the project grows.</li>
</ul>

<p>This API collects anonymous browser data to support the core messaging functionality.  This is the only data collection on this website; there are no other trackers.</p>

<h2>Affiliation</h2>

<p>Like the original, this website is not affiliated in any way with the developers or the original Last War game.</p>
