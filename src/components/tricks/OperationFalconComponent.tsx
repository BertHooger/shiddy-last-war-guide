                        At the start and as you play, avoid doing the Special Ops in Operation Falcon unless you really need more troops. These ops give you free troops based on how well you keep soldiers alive during the stage, and when you finish a Special Op you receive that amount with the troop level equal to the highest trainable level in your barracks.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-foreground/90 font-semibold">
                        Focus on upgrading your barracks as much as possible before trying to get free troops. In the troops guide, you can find more information on how barracks and troop levels work.

                        Instead, swipe left to a previous level (that you already completed) that you know your squad should be able to win and start that.

                        Important: Doing so you will be able to play only one level for that Mission category instead of 2, but at least you will complete all the stages and so farm many rewards.
