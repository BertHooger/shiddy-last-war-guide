                    Soldiers participate in attacks and provide power so it is important to always upgrade them to the highest level, but there is a trick on how to do that and at the same time earn many more points for Arms Race and Duel VS. The total amount of time and resources spent is the same.

                            <li>A barrack can train soldiers only up to a specific level that depends on the barrack level, see paragraphs above for the levels</li>
                            <li>A barrack can upgrade a soldier level but the upgrade can only be from any lower level to directly the maximum level the barrack can train. (e.g., barrack level 24 can upgrade T3-{'>'}T8)</li>
                            <li>The time and resources needed to train a soldier directly to a level or passing through multiple levels is the same (+- some seconds)</li>
                            <li>Points for Arms Race: Unit Progression and Duel VS: Day 5: Total Mobilization are earned each time a soldier reaches a level, whether from direct training or upgrades</li>
                            <li>You can have up to 4 barracks, just adapt this approach to the number of barracks you have</li>

                    <p>To score more points for Arms Race: Unit Progression and Duel VS: Day 5: Total Mobilization, the training of soldiers should be stepped. The maximization of those points can be reached only if your barracks follow a certain rule of how you level them up.</p>
                    <p className="mt-4">Given the Barracks level requirements expressed in the previous paragraphs, you will want to arrange the barracks so that the highest level one unlocks a higher soldier level than the next barracks in descending level order. So DON&apos;T upgrade blindly your barracks to highest level.</p>
