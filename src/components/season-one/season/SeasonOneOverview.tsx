                            After the fall of the Doom Legion, the world experienced a fleeting peace. Dr. Noab, who escaped in a hurry, left behind unresolved secrets beneath the Capitol.

                            Fifteen years earlier, he had arrived at a castle in the north, where he quickly married the young <strong>Lady in Red</strong>, the estate&apos;s owner. She was aware that he was after her family&apos;s secret artifact the <strong>Gift of Blood Spawn</strong>. Despite this she chose to ally with Noah to form the Doom Legion, hoping to restore her family&apos;s former glory and ascend as queen of the world.

                        <p>
                            Ten years ago, the driven <strong>Lady in Red</strong> took a daring step by injecting herself with the Gift of Blood Spawn. She then secluded herself underground, biding her time until the moment was right.

                            Now as the queen emerges, she brings forth the <strong>Crimson Plague</strong>, plunging humanity into turmoil. <strong>Commander</strong>, the stage is set for a deadly conflictâ€”this is your chance to demonstrate that you are the true ruler of this world!
